# Intro to Pair Programming

## Learning Goals

- Define pair programming and its parts: navigator and driver

## Introduction

Different contexts call for different methods of programming: sometimes it's best to pair, and sometimes it's best to work solo.

## Pair Programming is Collaborative Problem-Solving

Pair programming is a method of programming in which two people problem-solve together on the same code simultaneously. Typically, during a pair-programming session, the two people trade and alternate the two roles "drive" and "navigator."

The driver is responsible for using the keyboard and mouse. This usually means this person types code and navigates the project.

The navigator is responsible for guiding the problem-solving process. The navigator actively reviews each line of code as it is typed, checks for errors, and thinks about the overall solution and how to get there.

### It Benefits Everyone

Study after study states that software built with the pair-programming process often has higher quality code than code written solo.

When two people collaborate and pair, it often results in:

- more simple design choices, and more readable code
- fewer bugs and logical errors
- higher morale
- shared knowledge through your team
- accountable time management
- improves focus
- mitigating the <abbr title="How many of your team would have to win the lottery for you to be unable to function?">"Lottery Factor"</abbr> AKA the <abbr title="Like the 'Lottery Factor' but instead they get hit by a bus">"Bus Factor"</abbr>

## The Process of Pair Programming

When two developers begin a session of pair programming, they should begin the process by talking about the goal of the session. **Often, the goal of pair programming is to learn or explore.**

Following these steps can help pairs be aligned and focused:

1. Start with a reasonably well-defined task before you sit down
1. Agree on one tiny goal at a time
1. Rely on your partner, support your partner
1. Talk a lot!
1. Sync up frequently
1. Take a moment to celebrate as you complete tasks and overcome problems
1. Switch roles often - at least every half hour

## Pairing Remotely

Sometimes it won't be possible to pair in person.  You may be far away from each other, have transportation issues or there might be a global pandemic.

You can still accomplish pair programming remotely by following the principles above.  

There are many software solutions you can use to make remote pairing go smoothly but even something as simple as screen sharing during a video call can do the trick.

You can also use some tools specifically made for remote pairing. If developing in VS Code, [VS Code's plugin Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) is an example of one of these tools. Tools like these will make it easier to do hand off between driving and navigating like you would if you were sitting next to each other in person.

### Rotating Roles

It is unhealthy in pair programming to stay in either the driver role or the navigator role for too long.

A common pattern is to set a timer for thirty minutes, and to switch roles every thirty minutes.

### How to Improve Pair Programming

#### **Skill Imbalance**

> Most of the time, what looks like a skill imbalance, isn’t. I’m going to argue here that the perception that you are “ahead of” or “behind” your partner is less accurate and less important than it may seem. ... A really important assumption to make is that each person has a lot of value to contribute to the work, regardless of experience or a perception of skill level. Assume that you and your partner are both amazing.

#### Empathy for yourself and others

> Radical self-acceptance is a skill like any other.

#### Asking for and Receiving Feedback

> Make eye contact, observe your partner’s body language, tone of voice, and stay silent while they are talking. Repeat their words in your head, and let them sink in. Nod or say “hm” to show that you are actively listening to their words. ...

> It’s normal to feel defensive and to want to show that you haven’t done anything wrong, but realize that’s not needed here. Thank your partner for sharing what most likely was a difficult thing to say. Take some silent time to consider the feedback from a calm place before responding.

#### Giving Feedback

> Here’s a good format:

>> During _____, when you did _____,I felt _____. In the future, I’d like to try _____.
 Is that something you’d be willing to do?

>Your partner’s answer might be “no”, and that’s totally ok! In that case, accept their answer, ask why, and keeping talking until you can agree on a course of action.

## Check for Understanding

Which of the following is the format of feedback recommended in "Humans' Guide to Pair Programming"?

During _____, when you did _____,I felt _____. In the future, I’d like to try _____.

What did the quote about "skill imbalance" above express?

- Skill imbalance isn't as accurate or important than it may seem. Assume that you and your partner are both amazing.
