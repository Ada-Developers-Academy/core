## Automated Tests Verify Code Correctness

Automated tests, often called "tests," are suites of code used to verify the correctness of another, separate suite of code.

Programmers write tests to communicate what needs to be proved in order for a feature to be complete.

**Example:**

Programmers run tests to get test output. For each test, it will either pass, fail, or give an error. Programmers should use this feedback to make more changes to their code if necessary, or to confirm that the feature is complete.

**Example:**

### Unit Tests Are for Small Units

Because there are a lot of different kinds of code, there are a lot of different kinds of tests. One kind is unit testing. Unit tests are automated tests focus on a unit, which is commonly a single function. They're used to check that given some specific arguments, the function returns some expected value.

**Example:**

### Test Cases and Scenarios

Testing a single function could have many unit tests to test it. Why? Based on the context, a single function could potentially have different arguments that give back different return values. Different scenarios in development can imply different arguments, which would produce different logic. All scenarios and possible outcomes of a function should be tested, as much as reasonably possible.
