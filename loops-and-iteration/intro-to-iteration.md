# Intro to Iteration

## Introduction

## Learning Goals

## Vocabulary and Synonyms

## Repeating Code Is Necessary Sometimes


### Loops Consider What Gets Repeated and When

Every kind of loop will ask developers to define:

- What code gets repeated
- When does that code get repeated

## Visualizing Loops Is Necessary

## Loops and Iteration Take Advantage of Variables

Being able to trace the how the value of variables change during each loop is crucial.

Often times, developers will use a whiteboard or a piece of paper to take notes about a loop as a table. Each row represents one "loop," or one entire duration of a loop body.

## Loops and Iteration Require Attention to Syntax

Loops often have very specific syntax, and most bugs with loops come from syntax errors.
