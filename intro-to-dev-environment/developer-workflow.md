# Developer Workflow

## Workflow

### Getting Started

1. Read through the whole problem statement
1. Write down any clarifying questions that have come up. Get answers if possible, or keep them on the side to check back on later.
1. Spend time thinking about the problem you're trying to solve. What does the problem expect, and what do you need to do to get there?
1. Spend time many sub-problems (smaller problems that make up the big problem).
1. Pick one sub-problem, and begin to write pseudocode.
1. Write out your first draft of your solution in code.
1. Check to see if your solution meets the expectations by running it.
1. Celebrate moving one step closer to your goal.
1. Stretch your body and take a breath.
1. Repeat!

1. Remember where you've left off. Were you in the middle of a task, or did you just complete one? Do you have any lingering code changes? What are they?
