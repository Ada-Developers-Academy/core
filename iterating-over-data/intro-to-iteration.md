# Intro to Iteration

## Introduction

Korey might have a summer reading list of a list of books she wants to read. She's an ambitious reader and so she needs to look through her long list all the time to find the right book. She might even want to proudly talk about her accomplishments at the end of the list, and find out how many pages she read.

Korey is not the only reader. What if we needed to do these operations for every reader out there with a reading list? What if someone had a reading list of a thousand books?

In programming, we can approach these problems with iteration.

## Learning Goals

- Define iteration

## Vocabulary and Synonyms

| Vocab | Definition | Synonyms | How to Use in a Sentence
| --- | --- | --- | ---
Iteration | A sequence of instructions that repeats | Loop | "We should iterate over that list," "My code never gets to the iteration part," "My code iterates over that dictionary to find the scores"

## Iteration is Repeating

Iteration in programming is a sequence of instructions that repeats.

When we iterate over a data structure, such as a list or a dictionary, we'll often say that we're iterating _**on**_ that list or data structure.

## Iteration Solves Problems

As programmers, as we see and solve more problems, we'll see a pattern about when to consider using iteration.

### Finding One Element

We can use iteration to _find_ a specific element from a list!

We can also use iteration to find a specific kind of element, or an element with a specific property.

Iteration is often used to find the _first_ element that matches the criteria.

**Example:** Looking through a reading list, and finding the first book with the title `"all about love"`.

**Example:** Looking through a reading list, and finding the first book that is a biography.

### Operating On Each Element

We can use iteration to perform an operation on each element in the list.

We can use iteration to do operations like...
- calculate something based off each element in a list
- collect each item in a list, modifying it, and put it in another list
- comparing each element to something else

**Example:** Looking through a reading list, and collecting the total number of pages of every book in the list

**Example:** Looking through a reading list, and putting each book into my shopping cart.

**Example:** Looking through a reading list, and seeing if each book is bigger than the English dictionary.

## Summary

There are so many other things that lists are great at, so we'll need to keep exploring over time.
