# Intro to Lightning Talks

## Introduction

Researching, learning, and teaching a topic can be intimidating. We might have the questions:

- How much do I need to research to know enough?
- How do I best communicate what I've learned?
- How do I practice talking to a team of people?

However, our healthiest careers might encourage us to teach and present to others! We should practice this skill as much as we can.

## A Short and Small Presentation Format

"Lightning talks" are a type of presentation format that emphasizes short length. Lightning talks are usually very short, and only last a few minutes, such as 2-10 minutes long.

Lightning talks can be about _**anything**_! Some of the best lightning talks share knowledge or experiences with the audience. Lightning talks can be informational, educational, inspirational, and/or anything else. The tone of these presentations can be serious, humorous, somber, light, and/or simple.

Lightning talks are a common talk format among (tech) conferences. There may be a "lightning talk" session, where a series of lightning talks are given one-after-another.

### Example Talks

Some example talk topics include:

- How to buy a used car
- How to make cinnamon rolls
- How to live on a boat
- My experience going down the Mississippi River
- Information about my home country

## The Goal of Lightning Talks

- Speaking to an audience
- Teaching an audience clearly and concisely
- Researching topics for a short presentation
